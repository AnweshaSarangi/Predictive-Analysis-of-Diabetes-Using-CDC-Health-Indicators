# Final-Team-Project
## Predictive Analysis of Diabetes Using CDC Health Indicators
 This project is a part of the AAI-500: Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

### Description
 This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes status (diabetes, pre-diabetes, or healthy) using the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. By examining the relationships between lifestyle factors, demographic information, and health outcomes, we seek to identify key predictors and improve early detection of diabetes.

### Methods Used
- Data Research and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning & Imbalance Handling
- Dimension Reduction
- Model Evaluation & Selection
- Hyperparameter Tuning

### Technology Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:
 - Python: The primary programming language used for data preparation.
 - Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
 - NumPy: A library for numerical operations.
 - Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for preprocessing and feature engineering.
 - Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for developing and presenting data preparation workflows.

### Installation 
 1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/AnweshaSarangi/Predictive-Analysis-of-Diabetes-Using-CDC-Health-Indicators.git`
 2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Final-Team-Project`
 3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `Jupyter Notebook`
 2. Run the analysis scripts in the provided order.
    - `1. Data Preparation.ipynb`
      This notebook contains all the steps necessary to clean and preprocess the data. It should be run first to ensure that the data is in the correct format for analysis.
      Ensure the prepared data is saved correctly.
    - `2. Data Analysis.ipynb`
      This notebook performs the analysis of the prepared data. It should run after `1. Data Preparation.ipynb`.
    - `3. Model Tuning.ipynb`
      This notebook focuses on training machine learning models and tuning their hyperparameters. It includes model evaluation and selection to achieve the best performance. It should run after `2. Model Tuning.ipynb`.
